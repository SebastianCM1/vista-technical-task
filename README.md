## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a **recording activity interface** where users can:

- View a timer while recording or playing.
- Input text based on the activity and submit it as the final answer.

This demonstrates:
- Frontend development skills.
- State management using React hooks.
- UI responsiveness and accessibility.
